This is a JavaScript project on building an app which stores books, add to the books and remove from the stored books.

## Built With

- HTML

  - `ul` Unordered List (To list out certain items on the page)
  - HTML `form`
  - `input` attributes; `placeholder`

- Java Script
- Implemented DOM manipulation in various parts of the project to make page dynamic.
- JS `Objects`, `Arrays`, & `Object Arrays` to store data of similar items.
- Implement the use of Arrow Functions `=>` and `{destructure}` methods to match the modern concentions.
- Made use of various `JS` objects and methods such as; `node.createElement()`, `node.AppendChild()`, `node.replaceChild()`, etc. to avoid the use of `innerHTML` for security considerations.
- Implemented `array.forEach()`, through the course of the project to loop through `objects` in the `Objects Array`; thus making it possible to manipulate the objects and produce desired result.
- Made use of `if Statements` to match specific use cases.
- Implement the use of `eventListeners` to make 'add' & 'remove' buttons functional.
- Implement the use of `array.find()` & `parseInt` to locate the specific books to remove when the appropriate button is clicked.
- The `JSON` API `stringify` & `parse` was implemented, to enable JS Objects to be used on windows local storage.
- The `node.localStorage` `set()` & `get()` methods were used to store and retrieve user inouts.
- Made use of the `HTMLCollection` API with DOM selector `document.querySelectorAll()` to manipulate a list of elements with same class.
- Implement `JS - Class` with static methids.

- CSS
  - Pseudo-selectors (hover; to add hover effect to certain elements)
  - Pseudo-elements
  - CSS position property
  - CSS media query to make page responsive for mobile
  - `Flexbox`
  - Transition property
  - CSS background property
  - CSS animation
